# Blue Iris Server for ST
Smartapp to manage Blue Iris Server from Smartthings app.

Using the Smartapp to check on the status of the Blue Irsi (BI) server and to set various configuration. This is just an initial project to see if I can write a Smartapp successfully after creating a successful custom device for each Blue Iris camera.
This is a learning project made possible by generous code contributors. 

Update 2/18/15
- got the SmartApp working to get status and list of cameras and the camera's settings.
- status of server can be seen as text.
- status of camera can be seen as text along with link to a snapshot and a video feed.
- camera's video feed is not looking good in the Smartthings app internal browser.
- Looking for ideas on what would a Blue Iris Server integration do on Smartthings versus just have indidual cameras as devices.
- May stop this project since I know aht I need to know to connect to the BI server and focus on the cameras as devices instead.
