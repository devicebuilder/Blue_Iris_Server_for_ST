# Blue Iris Server for ST
Smartapp to manage Blue Iris Server from Smartthings app.

Using the Smartapp to check on the status of the Blue Irsi (BI) server and to set various configuration. This is just an initial project to see if I can write a Smartapp successfully after creating a successful custom device for each Blue Iris camera.
This is a learning project made possible by generous code contributors.
