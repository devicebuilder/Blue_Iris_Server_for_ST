This is just an initial project to see if I can write a Smartapp successfully after creating a successful custom device for each Blue Iris camera.\r\nThis is a learning project made possible by generous code contributors. \r\n\r\nUpdate 2/18/15\r\n- got the SmartApp working to get status and list of cameras and the camera's settings.\r\n- status of server can be seen as text.\r\n- status of camera can be seen as text along with link to a snapshot and a video feed.\r\n- camera's video feed is not looking good in the Smartthings app internal browser.\r\n- Looking for ideas on what would a Blue Iris Server integration do on Smartthings versus just have indidual cameras as devices.\r\n- May stop this project since I know aht I need to know to connect to the BI server and focus on the cameras as devices instead.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
